# JingBh's Website

This is the source of JingBh's personal website.

## Versions:

Currently, this repository contains version 5.0 of the website.

Historical versions are:

 - `4.1` — Removed [`Laravel`](https://laravel.com) to make the website pure frontend, used a self-written [`Webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/) configuration to build assets.
 - `4.0` — Used [`Laravel`](https://laravel.com) as a backend, moved to a new animated UI with self-written CSS and [`ScrollReveal`](https://scrollrevealjs.org/).
 - `3.0` — Moved to [`ThinkPHP`](https://www.thinkphp.cn/).
 - `2.0` — Self-written stupid PHP backend and the page was based on a template from [`Dreamweaver`](https://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html).
 - `1.0` — This is so embarrassing to see now, as this is the first website I ever made, and I was only 14 back then.
